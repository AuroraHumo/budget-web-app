# BUDGET GENERATOR WEB APP (React)

## ✍️ Description

Creation of a dynamic web app to generate service budgets using **React**.

Users can select services, fill in their personal data, and save their budget requests.

The budget list can be **sorted by name or date** and **reset to its original order** .

The app uses components, state lifting, and routing via `react-router-dom`.
